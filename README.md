# Bypassing-AT-T-s-BGW320-500-Gateway-with-Unifi-Cloud-Gateway-UCG-Fiber-Using-wpa_supplicant
This guide details my process for bypassing the AT&amp;T BGW320-500 gateway (the large, bulky Optical Network Terminal or ONT box) and replacing it with a Unifi Cloud Gateway (UCG) Fiber using a wpa_supplicant bypass method. It's specifically tailored for the AT&amp;T BGW320-500 model.
